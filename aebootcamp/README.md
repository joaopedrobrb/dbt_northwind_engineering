Welcome to my project using Google Cloud + dbt!

### In this project, I've used Google Cloud as a Data Warehouse and dbt to do the transforms into my dataset.

You can see all phases of data transformations at aebootcamp/models/
- warehouse
- staging
- analytics_obt


I've used the Northwind Database by Microsoft to learn and practice my dbt skills.
